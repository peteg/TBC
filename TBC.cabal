Synopsis: Testing By Convention
Category: Testing
Description:

 TBC is a harness for running tests, relying on other libraries such
 as QuickCheck and HUnit to do the actual testing. If the tests follow
 conventions, TBC lets you skip a lot of boilerplate. It also supports
 test-driven development (TDD) by running as many tests as it can
 compile, whatever the state of the project as a whole.
