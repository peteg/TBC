- generalise Cabal support
 - currently assumes there's a single target (only tested for 'Library')
 - doesn't make sense to run all the tests for all targets
- include line number info
- Hugs/etc. support needs some love from someone who cares
- remove the concurrency in the GHCi driver if possible
- add a Sanity convention
- add timeouts, restarting GHCi, several GHCi's.
  - really? how do we know how long tests should take?
- run several GHCis concurrently

Works now: allow it to use cabal-built objects from dist/build
... but: investigate the GHCi module header bug
 - leaving off "module T where" from the top of tests yields e.g.

not ok 13 - Tests/00_Circuits/022_xor_loop.hs:prop_correct
# <interactive>:1:5:
#     Can't find interface-file declaration for variable prop_correct
#       Probable cause: bug in .hi-boot file, or inconsistent .hi file
#       Use -ddump-if-trace to get an idea of which file caused the error
#     In the first argument of `test', namely `prop_correct'
#     In the expression: test prop_correct
#     In the definition of `it': it = test prop_correct

= TBC Design Desiderata =

- implicit
- directory of tests in conventional place ($PROJECT/Tests)
- minimal boilerplate on individual test files
  - no requirement for module header (hierarchical module names screw us, tests can't be easily moved)
  - convention for "test_", "prop_" - run them as HUnit and QC props.
- uses Cabal to build the project, and supports the FFI, etc.

- consistent reporting of passing/failing tests. if we've written N tests,
   that should be reflected in the report, even if they're broken.
- TAP compliant, so we can hook it into buildbot or whatever - no more NIH stuff
- graceful handling of uncompilable tests
- talk about test discovery in directory tree

TODO {
  - if you define mainPlannedTestSuite :: (Plan Int, IO TestSuiteResult), we assume you need control and we'll run it and merge the TAP with other tests. (also mainTestSuite)
  - elsif you define mainTestGroup :: (Plan Int, IO TestGroupResult), we assume you need control and we'll run it and merge the TAP with other tests.
  - elsif you define main :: IO (), we'll treat it as a single test that's passed if it compiles and runs without an exception (?) -- quick and dirty.

  - need some way to choose renderers
  - possibly also a config file to store prefs
}

- Test Classes, applying to test suites
 - climb TestSuite tree until we find TestClass.hs
 - contains vetTestSuite :: FilePath -> IO TestResult
   - provide recursive enumTests :: FilePath -> (FilePath -> IO a) -> IO a
 - this is really testing the test suite for various properties. more thought.
